# VictoriusSecret

Simple web app mimicking a normal social media website.

The project is structured as a package (vsapp). The database is SQLite.

To start the app in the terminal run "flask --app vsapp run" because you have to specify the app as it will throw an error otherwise.

Team: Mark, Tommaso, Martina, Tuli.
